Show HN: quickTERMINAL – A 10k-line single-file terminal emulator for macOS
```

**Text (optional, als erster Kommentar):**

Hey HN,

I built a terminal emulator for macOS from scratch in a single Swift file.

- 13,000+ lines, one file, zero dependencies
- Hand-rolled VT100/VT220/xterm parser (13-state FSM)
- Native Cocoa rendering at 60 FPS (no Electron, no WebView)
- Lives in the menu bar, toggle with Ctrl+<
- Full 24-bit TrueColor, Sixel graphics, mouse tracking, Kitty keyboard protocol
- Built-in command palette (quickBAR) with 40 commands
- Multi-tab, split panes, session restore
- Auto-updater that checks GitHub Releases every 72h
- Built-in WebPicker — Chrome CDP element picker, select any DOM element, copies HTML to clipboard
- 4.8 MB app bundle, ~1.4 MB binary

No SwiftTerm, no libvte, no terminal library. Every escape sequence parsed from scratch.

The whole thing compiles with a single `swiftc` call.

I've been building a terminal emulator for macOS entirely from scratch.

The entire app is a single Swift file — 13,000+ lines, no external dependencies, no Electron, no WebView.

What makes it different:
- Lives in your menu bar (no dock icon), toggle with Ctrl+<
- Hand-rolled VT parser (13-state FSM) — every escape sequence built from zero
- 60 FPS native Cocoa rendering with sub-pixel text
- 24-bit TrueColor, Sixel inline images, mouse tracking
- quickBAR command palette (like Spotlight for your terminal)
- Multi-tab, split panes, 7 prompt themes
- Session restore — tabs, splits, working directories all preserved
- Built-in auto-updater
- WebPicker — Chrome CDP element picker (select DOM elements, copy outerHTML to terminal)
- 4.8 MB app bundle

Free for personal use. Source is open on GitHub.

I built a complete terminal emulator in a single Swift file — 10,000+ lines, zero dependencies, pure Cocoa
```

**Text:**
```
Wanted to share a project I've been working on: quickTERMINAL — a fully featured terminal emulator for macOS, written entirely in one Swift file.

Some technical highlights:
- 13-state finite automaton VT parser — single-pass byte processing
- Zero-allocation ASCII fast-path (no String creation for plain text)
- Incremental UTF-8 decoding across read boundaries
- Direct CGContext rendering at 60 FPS with dirty-flag optimization
- Synchronized output (mode 2026) for flicker-free drawing
- Full SGR with 24-bit TrueColor + 256-color palette
- Inline Sixel graphics decoded on-the-fly
- PTY management with Carbon global hotkey (Ctrl+<)
- Compiles with a single `swiftc` call — no Xcode project, no SPM

No SwiftTerm, no libvte — every escape sequence implemented from scratch.

The architecture: Terminal (parser + grid) → TerminalView (NSView + PTY + rendering) → AppDelegate (window, tabs, splits)

Would love feedback from other Swift devs. What would you do differently with a 10k-line single-file project?

quickTERMINAL: A macOS terminal emulator written from scratch — 10k lines, single file, native rendering
```

**Text:**
```
Built a terminal emulator for macOS that lives in your menu bar.

Quick facts:
- Single Swift file, ~10,000 lines
- VT100/VT220/xterm compatible (hand-rolled parser)
- 24-bit TrueColor, Sixel graphics, mouse tracking (1000/1002/1003)
- SGR mouse encoding, bracketed paste, focus reporting
- Kitty keyboard protocol
- OSC 52 clipboard, OSC 8 hyperlinks, OSC 133 shell integration
- TERM=xterm-256color, COLORTERM=truecolor
- Built-in command palette, multi-tab, split panes
- Auto-updater via GitHub Releases

Works great with vim, neovim, tmux, htop, and most TUI apps.
